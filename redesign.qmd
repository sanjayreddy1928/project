title: "Redesigned Graphs"

### First Redesign:

#### Bar Graph:

**Simplification and Clarity**: The horizontal bar chart simplifies the comparison of weighted batting averages across players. By using a single metric per bar (the weighted batting average), the visualization directly communicates one aspect of player performance, reducing complexity.

**Use of Color Gradient**: To represent runs scored at home, the bar chart employs a color gradient ranging from light blue to blue. This specific aesthetic choice not only adds a visual dimension to the data but also facilitates an intuitive understanding of runs scored in relation to batting averages. Importantly, this is achieved without overcrowding the chart with multiple data points or elements.

**Improved Readability**: The readability of player names is improved by flipping the chart to a horizontal orientation. This adjustment also allows for better utilization of space, particularly when compared to the original graph where text overlap proved problematic.

**Interactive Elements**: By converting the static version of the chart to an interactive format using plotly, user engagement is further enhanced.This interactive feature enables a detailed exploration of the data through tooltips, thereby providing a more interactive and immersive experience.

### **Second Redesign:**

#### Scatter Plot:

**Direct Comparison of Two Metrics**: The redesign of the scatter plot allows for a direct comparison between runs scored and batting averages, thus showcasing the relationship between these two significant metrics. Each player is represented by a point on the plot, positioned according to their performance statistics.

**Color Coding by Player**: Enhancing the distinction between players, assigning a unique color to each individual improves the ability to track and analyze individual performances across the plot.

**Interactivity with Tooltips**: The utilization of plotly for interactivity introduces tooltips that provide detailed information, such as the player's name, batting average, and runs scored, when hovering over a data point. This addition effectively addresses the potential issue of overlapping labels and enhances the dynamic informativeness of the visualization.

**Adjustable Y-Axis Scale**: Setting the y-axis to start from 0 and extend beyond the maximum runs scored ensures that the data representation is proportionate and grounded, enhancing the plot's interpretability.

## Conclusion:

The interpretability and readability of cricket player performance data are significantly enhanced by the redesigned visualizations in comparison to the original graph. The original graph's shortcomings, such as text overlap and ambiguous data representation, are addressed by the new designs through the utilization of a horizontal bar chart and an interactive scatter plot. The intuitive color gradient of the horizontal bar chart effectively conveys runs scored at home, while the scatter plot allows for an interactive and detailed examination of the relationship between runs scored and batting averages. These enhancements not only simplify data interpretation but also contribute to an engaging user experience, ensuring that the insights are both accessible and compelling.
