The motivation for undertaking this project is based on the recognition that although the initial representation of data offers a fundamental understanding of its arrangement and potential consequences, there frequently exists a wide array of alternative viewpoints and stories that can be revealed through imaginative and contemplative reconfiguration.

In the process of redesigning the chosen visualization, this project will critically evaluate the effectiveness of different design choices in conveying the intended message.

Moreover, the project will explore the role of context in visualization design, considering how the intended audience and the medium of presentation can impact design decisions.
